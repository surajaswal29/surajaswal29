### 👋 Hi there, I'm Suraj Aswal

Hey! I'm a curious and driven developer passionate about building modern web applications using the **MERN Stack**, **Next.js**, **NestJS**, and **PHP**. I enjoy working with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**, and love diving deep into the full stack to bring ideas to life.

Lately, I’ve been working on projects that integrate powerful **AI/ML models** like **OpenAI’s GPT**, **Google Gemini**, and **Vertex AI**—using them to enhance user experiences, automate workflows, and solve real-world problems with intelligent solutions.

I'm also exploring the world of **IoT** (just getting started!) and getting my hands dirty with **Rust**—a language that’s caught my attention for its performance and system-level control.

Always learning. Always building. Always leveling up. 🚀
