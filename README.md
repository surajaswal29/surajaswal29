### 👋 Hi there, I'm Suraj Aswal

Hey! I'm a curious and driven developer who loves building modern web apps with the **MERN stack**, **Next.js**, **NestJS**, and even **PHP** when it makes sense. I enjoy working with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**, and I genuinely like digging into the full stack to bring ideas to life.

Recently, I’ve been working on projects powered by **AI/ML models** like **GPT**, **Gemini**, **Vertex AI**, plus frameworks like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build smarter tools, automate stuff, and solve real-world problems with AI. I’m also getting deeper into **RAG**, **Agentic AI**, and experimenting with ways to combine them into real products.

I’m actively learning **System Design**, starting my journey in **IoT**, and exploring **Rust** to expand my system-level understanding.

Always learning. Always building. Always leveling up. 🚀
