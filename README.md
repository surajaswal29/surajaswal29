### 👋 Hi there, I'm Suraj Aswal

Hey! I'm a curious and driven developer who enjoys building modern web apps with the **MERN stack**, **Next.js**, **NestJS**, and even **PHP** when it makes sense (you know… those *cheap hosting* moments 😂). I love working with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**, and I like getting into the full stack to turn ideas into something real and useful.

Lately, I’ve been working on projects using **GPT**, **Gemini**, **Vertex AI**, and tools like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build smarter workflows, automate things that waste time, and create practical AI-driven solutions. I’ve also been digging into **RAG** and **Agentic AI** to understand how they can fit into real-world systems.

I’ve been putting more focus on **system design**, **DevOps basics**, and improving how I plan and structure projects architecture decisions, workflow planning, optimization, and making sure whatever I build feels good to use. I’m also exploring **IoT** and learning **Rust** to expand my understanding of things at a lower level.

Always learning. Always building. Always leveling up. 🚀
